# AI Fluency Framework

***

## What is AI Fluency?

AI Fluency is more than just using AI tools—it's about using AI **effectively, efficiently, ethically, and safely**. It's the difference between simply automating tasks and genuinely augmenting your capabilities.

### Automation vs. Augmentation

- **Automation:** Having AI do work *for* you without thinking deeply about what you're asking or the impact
- **Augmentation:** Using AI to help you do your work *better*, especially important in learning contexts

**Key principle:** We want AI to help us do our work better, not do our work for us.

***

## The 4D Framework

The foundation of AI fluency consists of four interconnected competencies:

1. **Delegation** - Who does what?
2. **Description** - How do we communicate?
3. **Discernment** - How do we evaluate?
4. **Diligence** - How do we stay responsible?

***

## 1. Delegation: Dividing the Work

**Core Question:** What work should humans do, what should AI do, and what should we do together?

### Three Types of Awareness

#### Problem Awareness
- Get clear on what you're actually trying to accomplish
- Define what success looks like before engaging with AI
- This becomes your "north star" during AI collaboration

**Example:**
- ❌ Vague: "I need to study for a test"
- ✅ Clear: "I need to review vocabulary, prepare for case studies, and practice problem-solving"

#### Platform Awareness
- Understand that different AI systems have different capabilities
- Some excel at complex reasoning
- Some are custom-built for specific tasks (like student learning)
- Choose the right tool for your specific need

**Analogy:** Like choosing transportation—walk, bike, bus, or drive depends on your circumstances.

#### Task Delegation
- Actually divide work between yourself and AI
- **Humans bring:** Creativity, judgment, real-world context
- **AI brings:** Speed, consistency, ability to process large amounts of information
- Best results happen when you play to both strengths

***

## 2. Description: Communicating with AI

Description is about having a **conversation with a collaborator**, not just giving commands or memorizing prompts.

### Three Dimensions of Description

#### Product Description
What you want from the final result:
- How long should it be?
- Who is the audience?
- What style should it use?
- What key messages must be included?
- What format is needed?

**Example:**
```
❌ "Write an email"
✅ "Write a 200-word professional email to my professor 
   requesting a meeting to discuss my research project. 
   Tone should be respectful and concise."
```

#### Process Description
How the AI should approach your request:
- "Think step by step"
- "Consider multiple perspectives"
- "Start with the most important points"
- "Question my assumptions"

**Think of it as:** Teaching another person how to do the task.

#### Performance Description
How you want AI to behave during the interaction:
- Need a critical editor? Say so.
- Want supportive brainstorming? Ask for it.
- Want it to challenge your thinking? Specify that.

**Example:**
- "Act as a supportive tutor who helps me discover answers"
- "Be a critical reviewer who points out weaknesses"
- "Be a creative brainstorming partner who builds on my ideas"

***

## 3. Discernment: Evaluating the Results

Discernment is about recognizing good vs. bad results and knowing how to adapt accordingly.

### Three Levels of Discernment

#### Product Discernment
Evaluate the quality of what AI creates:
- Is the information accurate?
- Do the suggestions actually help?
- Did it show you something you hadn't considered?
- Is it factually correct?

**Remember:** This isn't just hunting for errors—it's also recognizing when AI genuinely helps you think better.

#### Process Discernment
Examine how the AI got there:
- Did it consider all relevant factors?
- Did it make reasonable assumptions?
- Did it follow logical steps?
- Can you understand and trust the reasoning?

#### Performance Discernment
How the AI behaved during interaction:
- Was it helpful in the way you needed?
- Did it stay in the role you asked for?
- Did it push back when appropriate?
- Did it respect your boundaries?

***

## The Description-Discernment Loop

**Critical concept:** Description and Discernment work together in a continuous feedback loop.

```
You describe → AI responds → You discern → You refine description → Repeat
```

This iterative process transforms AI from a tool into a thinking partner.

**Example progression:**
1. "Help me think through ideas for my essay"
2. *AI responds with general ideas*
3. You discern what's useful and what's missing
4. "Let's focus on the structure—how can I organize these three main arguments?"
5. *AI provides more specific structural guidance*
6. You continue refining...

***

## 4. Diligence: Taking Responsibility

Diligence ensures AI engagement remains **responsible, transparent, and ethical**.

### Three Types of Diligence

#### Creation Diligence
Thoughtfully selecting which AI systems to use and how to interact:
- Consider privacy and security
- Choose appropriate tools for your context
- Set boundaries for different situations

**Questions to ask:**
- Is this AI system appropriate for this task?
- Am I protecting my privacy and others'?
- What data am I sharing?

#### Transparency Diligence
Being honest about how you've worked with AI:
- Tell professors, teammates, employers when AI helped
- Explain *how* AI contributed to your work
- Showcase your ability to collaborate with AI fluently

**Key insight:** Done right, you have nothing to hide. You're demonstrating a valuable professional skill.

#### Deployment Diligence
Taking ownership of what you create with AI:
- Verify accuracy
- Ensure appropriateness
- Take responsibility for the final result

**Remember:**
- AI might draft the email, but **you** send it
- AI might suggest ideas, but **you** choose which to use
- **You are always responsible for the final result**

## Practical Exercise: Creating Your Learning Context Document

### Step 1: Self-Reflection (5 minutes)

**Academic Context:**
- What are you studying and at what level? 
  - I am studying programming at a beginner level while enrolled in an Engineering degree
- What are your strongest and weakest subject areas? 
  - Strongest: Math, Calculus and Programming
  - Weakest: Physics 
- What types of assignments do you work on?
  - Lab reports, code programs, etc.
- What are your academic goals?
  - I am currently considering transferring to a Bachelor's degree program in Information Systems to study and focus on the area I enjoy and want to work in.

**Learning Style:**
- How do you learn best?
  - Doing exercises, personal projects and by taking courses
- What challenges do you face?
  - As a beginner, I stuck with some specific topics, but with enough practice, I get over it
- Where do you need most support?
  - In my career path, I'm confused with the options I can choose
- What motivates you?
  - My mother already lives abroad, I am a student in Brazil. I think that, dreaming of a life abroad nearby here, motivates me a lot

**AI Experience:**
- What experience do you have with AI?
  - I have a good knowledge with AI, and at the moment, I think I use it in a way it helps me learning, and not interfering with my studies
- What concerns do you have?
  - I fear how AI will be used for bad things in the future, and how it's getting hard to say what is or is not AI. But for my study purposes, it already helps me a lot, and I'm pretty sure it will just keep getting better
- What do you hope to achieve with AI?
  - I hope I can do some really nice projects in the future and study in a faster pace because of AI assistance
- What boundaries do you want to set?
  - I want to still doing my work, coding and thinking by my own. Most of the times I use AI, I give it a prompt to help me enhance my thinking and critical analysis, but the work is still done by me. I don't want to become lazy and get dumbing for not thinkink and leaving everything to some AI's, I know it happens a lot out there. But I want to be smart and self-taught enough to make AI help me in my career.

### Step 2: Building the Document with AI (15 minutes)

**Opening conversation:**
```
"I'm a student building a learning context document to help us 
work together effectively. I want to use AI to enhance my learning, 
not replace it. Here's my context..."
```

**Key areas to explore:**
- Your current courses and challenges
- Your goals and what success looks like
- Your preferred study methods
- When you want AI support vs. independent work
- Your school's AI policies

**Establish boundaries:**
- Make clear you want to learn, not have work done for you
- Discuss academic integrity
- Set expectations for the type of help you want

### Step 3: Finalize Your Document (5 minutes)

**Ask the AI to:**
- Synthesize your discussion into a structured document
- Include a "How I Want to Work with AI" section
- Make it reusable for future sessions

**Save this document** to share at the start of future AI learning sessions!

## Reflection Questions

1. What surprised you about articulating your learning needs?
   - I am excited to be more self-taught, what surprised me the most is know how AI can be a game changer and help us pursue your achievements in a faster pace
2. How do you think having a learning context will improve your AI interactions?
   - It will make AI set boundares on whether what to do or not and it will set it to behave in a way it will really enhance my learning, not harm it
3. Which of the 4Ds do you feel most comfortable with? Which needs more practice?
   - I think the discernment one. But, even though I do some good prompts, I need to practice more the Description part in order to make my thoughts more organized and get better results
4. How can you ensure you're augmenting, not automating, your learning?
   - By establishing boundaries for the AI's I use. I will do it reusing my learning context document, emphasizing I want to learn and use it as a tutor, and not a tool to work for me (and by doing good prompts while working in my description skill too)

***

**Remember:** Start practicing with your next AI interaction. Notice which D you're using. Try being more intentional about each one. Your AI collaborations will improve quickly!
