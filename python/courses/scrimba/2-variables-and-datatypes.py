# Scrimba Python 101 - Exercise 2: Variables and Datatypes
# Topic: Variable assignment and understanding different data types

print('Variables & Datatypes - Exercise')

# Exercise: Create appropriate variables for an item in a store inventory
# Requirements:
# - Item name (string)
# - Price (float - for monetary values)
# - Stock quantity (integer - whole numbers only)

# Variable assignments with appropriate data types
item_name = "macbook"    # str: Product name
price = 1249.99          # float: Price with decimal places
in_stock = 4             # int: Whole number representing quantity

# Note: Python automatically infers the data type based on the value assigned
# - Strings: enclosed in quotes (' ' or " ")
# - Floats: numbers with decimal points
# - Integers: whole numbers without decimal points
