# Scrimba Python 101 - Exercise 1: Print Statement and Program Flow
# Topic: Basic print() function and string concatenation

# Demonstrating basic print statements
# Note: First line appears to have a typo ('101!2' instead of '101!')
print('Welcome to Python 101!2')
print('Welcome to Python 101!')

# Print statements execute sequentially (top to bottom)
print("Create hammer")
print('Create nails')

# String concatenation using the + operator
# Both single quotes ('') and double quotes ("") work the same in Python
print("Use hammer" + ' and use nails')
