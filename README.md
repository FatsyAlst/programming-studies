# Programming Studies

This repository collects my personal programming exercises, coursework, and practice problems. It serves as a workspace for learning, tracking progress, and keeping small experiments organized. I maintain solutions to exercises from platforms such as Exercism and HackerRank, course assignments, and miscellaneous practice files.

**Purpose**: personal learning, reference, and portfolio for practice code and assignments.

**Status**: active — this `README.md` will be updated as new folders and files are added.

**Table of Contents**
- **Overview**: short description and goals.
- **Structure**: high-level layout of folders.
- **How to use**: how to navigate and run code.
- **Maintaining this README**: how to add entries when you add content.
- **Contact / Notes**: optional personal notes.

**Overview**

This workspace is organized by source and purpose (exercises, coursework, media, recorded notes). Files are mostly Python exercises and course assignments, grouped into subfolders. Use this repository to review past exercises, re-run assignments, or continue ongoing practice.

**Structure**

All files and folders now follow kebab-case naming conventions (lowercase with hyphens) for better consistency and readability:

- `exercism/` : solutions and practice exercises organized by track and exercise.
- `hackerank/` : practice problems and solutions for HackerRank exercises.
- `media/` : supporting assets (images, reference files) used by exercises or notes.
- `project-euler.ipynb` : Project Euler problem solutions and implementations.
- `python/courses/` : course materials, notebooks, and assignment files from online courses:
  - `michigan/` : University of Michigan courses (Python for Everybody series).
  - `udemy/` : Udemy course materials and exercises.
  - `university-of-colorado-boulder/` : CU Boulder Python courses (fundamentals and functions).
  - `university-of-toronto/` : University of Toronto programming courses.
- `usp/` : university coursework and class assignments.
- `playground.py` : a small scratch file for quick experiments.
- `README.md` : this file — a short guide to the repository.
